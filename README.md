smart System to Assist Blind

This repository contains a complete Software Engineering project
titled "Smart System to Assist the Blind".

The project focuses on designing an intelligent mobile-based system
that helps visually impaired users interact safely and independently
with their surrounding environment using artificial intelligence
and computer vision technologies.

## Project Overview
The system acts as "electronic eyes" connected to a smartphone and provides:
- Real-time environment description
- Object and obstacle detection
- Text reading using OCR
- Voice-based user interaction
- Safety alerts during movement

## Methodology
- Agile Development Methodology (Scrum)
- Requirement Analysis (SRS)
- System Design using UML diagrams

## Technologies Mentioned
- Flutter (Mobile Application)
- Python (Backend)
- YOLO & Computer Vision Models
- OCR & NLP
- PostgreSQL Database

## Project Contents
- Project_Report: Full software engineering documentation (PDF)
- Diagrams: UML and system diagrams (Use Case, DFD, ERD, Class, etc.)

## Field
Software Engineering / Information Technology
